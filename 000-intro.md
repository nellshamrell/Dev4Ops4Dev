Don't settle in too much (power cords, etc) - we'll move around in just a bit.

## Splitting into Groups

We're going to run the workshop using 5 groups of 6.  Each group will
choose a name for themselves, using their favorite one-word dessert
(pie, cupcake, etc).

First, we want any attendees who don't feel very comfortable on the
Unix command line to form a group.  We'll be providing special
coaching to that group, so you don't spend the workshop floundering
with your 'ls' and 'dir's.

For everyone else, we'd prefer that you mix up - don't be in the same
group as people from your company, for example.  To do that, let's
have everyone else count off by 5's.

Find your group and move your gear.

In each group, decide on a name, and call it out.  Once a name has
been called out, it's taken.  Write your group's name down on the
table stand provided.

# Version Control with Git

So, now we have a working machine from which to do some development and some operations!  What do we need next?

Some code, of course!

## Welcome to WidgetWorld!

The app we'll be supporting is called WidgetWorld.  Widget World is a generic e-commerce site for selling widgets of all shapes and sizes.  It's at the very beginning of its life, right now all you can do is add new widgets, edit widgets, see all widgets, and delete widgets.

You can look at the code for WidgetWorld on GitHub.

  https://github.com/nellshamrell/widgetworld

You can browse around, look at it, read files.  You can even download ZIP files!

But how are we going to get the code?  The ZIP files seem like it would work fine.... but the developers all want to use "version control"....

## Why use Version Control?

We could just grab some code using a tarball, and go from there.  In fact, many of us have worked that way.

### Problems without Version Control

Some problems start to crop up:

 * It's hard to sync copies of the code - which version is "right"?
 * It's hard to have one person work on a special feature while everyone else works on the main thing
 * You can't travel back in time and see what the code was like before - you don't get backups.

Version Control Systems (VCS) address these problems and more.  There have been many over the years - CVS, SVN, Perforce, VSS, and on and on - but today the dominant VCS by far is git.

### Why git?

The main advantage of git over its predecessors is that it is distributed - that means that even though many people might have a copy of the code, no copy is more "authoritative" than any other, unless the humans decide to treat one copy as special.  You don't have to have a server, but you can if you want.  Git is also really fast at being distributed, and keeps some concepts separate that had been blurred before (like branching vs directory structure), which makes it easier and clearer to think about some things.

Another huge part of git's popularity is the handful of big git hosting services - Github and Bitbucket probably being the most famous.  10 years ago "participating in open-source software" meant emailing patches; today, it means opening a pull request on github, with public space for contribution, discussion, and maintainer handoff.

On the downside, git is really, really complex under the hood - or beautifully simple depending on who you ask.  Either way, it has a massive learing curve just past the "beginnner level".  It's also fairly unopinionated - you can make many different workflows using it, but it won't have one obvious right way to do something.

We'll learn just enough git today to do most common tasks, and talk a bit about the workflow.

## How do people Collaborate with Git and Github?

The most common workflow is something like this:

 1. You and Nell both have Github accounts.
 2. You are using Nell's code, and need to make a change to it that would benefit the world, or at least you.
 3. You check the LICENSE and verify it's something you can contribute to.
 4. You *fork* Nell's repo.  You now have a complete copy of the code in your github account.
 5. You *clone* your own copy of the repo to your computer.  Now you can locally edit the files.
 6. You *branch* the code, naming it "add-myself-to-readme".  This lets you work on the feature, but if it takes longer than you thought, you can switch back to the regular, "master" branch anytime, then continue later.
 7. You keep *commit* as you go, in chunks of work that make sense, and hopefully leave the code in a working state after each commit.
 8. You *push* to send the changes from your development machine to your github account for safekeeping.  Until you push, the changes only exist on your machine - no matter how many times you comittted!
 9. When you think you want Nell to look at it, you issue a *pull request*, asking Nell to *pull* from your add-myself-to-readme branch to her master branch.  Discussion may ensue, and you can revise your PR by continuing to commit to your branch.

Let's try all that!

## Getting Setup

### Making an SSH Key

Most git servers authenticate with each other using SSH keys.  So, you'll need an SSH keypair.

NOTE: if you already have a keypair and a github account, you can skip this; just make sure your ssh-agent is carrying your key when you are inside the Vagrant VM.

#### Generate the Key

```bash
  vagrant@workshop $ ssh-keygen -C "devops workshop key"
  # Accept location
  # Enter a secure passphrase & confirm
  vagrant@workshop $ ls -l ~/.ssh/
```

IMPORTANT - If anyone asks you to "Send me your SSH key", they are asking for the PUBLIC key - the .pub file.  Never share the other file, called the private key!

#### Start your SSH Agent

ssh-agent is a program that acts as a sort of keyring for you.  You can give it your private key half, and it will securely carry it around for you - including making it available to git, to prove you are who you claim to be.

First, let's see if your SSH agent is running.

```bash
  vagrant@workshop $ ssh-add -l
```

If you see 'Could not establish a connection with your agent', that means it is not running (nearly any other result means it is.)

If you need to start ssh-agent, run:

```bash
  vagrant@workshop $ eval $(ssh-agent)
```

#### Load your key into SSH Agent

```bash
  vagrant@workshop $ ssh-add .ssh/id_rsa
  # Provide your passphrase
```

Verify that the key was loaded:
```bash
  vagrant@workshop $ ssh-add -l
```

### Configure your Local Git Client

To do this, set up your global git name (this is what identifies you in your commits) through this command:

```bash
  vagrant@workshop $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Now configure your global git email address (this will be included in your commits) through this command:

```bash
  vagrant@workshop $ git config --global user.email "your_email@your_email_domain.com"
```

Check that the values are stored correctly by running:

```bash
  vagrant@workshop $ git config --list
```

### Create a GitHub Account

If you have not already done so, create a [Github account](https://github.com/).  This will give us a place outside of our developer workstation to keep our Chef recipes, etc.

Once you have a github account, you will need to add your *public* SSH key to it.

First, we'll copy the new public key from your workshop VM onto your laptop.

```bash
  vagrant@workshop $ cp ~/.ssh/id-rsa.pub /vagrant/github-ssh-public-key.pub
```

You should find that github-ssh-public-key.pub in the same directory as the workshop Vagrantfile.

Follow Github's instructions (https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/#step-4-add-your-ssh-key-to-your-account).

## Forking and Cloning a Repo

### Fork to make your own copy of the code

On the github website, make sure you are logged in.  Then find Nell's widgetworld repo, by searching for nellshamrell/widgetworld.  Click the big Fork button!

Note: "fork" is not a 'git' command - it's a term used by Git hosting companies to represent a server-side clone.

#### Sidebar: It's OK to Fork

In the past, when a project "forked," that meant there had been a rift in the project leadership, and a splinter faction had broken off, to create their own vision of the software.  A fork was irreversible, and divided communities.  With Github, forks are routine.  It simply means you are a making your own copy to work on, and it's easy to send your work back "upstream" to the original project - or, you can choose never to send your changes back upstream, while still receiving changes from the upstream project.  Popular projects like Chef might have thousands of forks!  Fork casually - it's no big deal.

### Clone to download your copy of the code from the git hosting service

You're now ready to fetch your copy of the code from the git hosting service Github, to your development machine.

If you visit the project page at https://github.com/YOUR_GITHIB_USERNAME/widgetworld , you'll see a "SSH git clone URL" textbox in the right sidebar.  That's where you will find the repo address you can use to clone.

NOTE 1: You'll almost always want the "SSH" url, not the HTTPS or Subversion repo URL.

NOTE 2: When running the next command, you will likely get an SSH unknown host challenge.  Respond that Yes, you would like to continue connecting.

```bash
  vagrant@workshop $ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/widgetworld.git
```

You should now have a widgetworld directory!

```bash
  vagrant@workshop $ tree -L 2 widgetworld
```

And git should think that it is unmodified:

```bash
  vagrant@workshop $ cd widgetworld
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld$ git status
  On branch master.
  Everything up to date.
```

Git also knows where the code came from.  Git repos that are able to be accessed over the network are called remotes, and the remote from which you got the code is called (by default) 'origin'.

```bash
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git remote -v
   origin	git@github.com:clintoncwolfe/widgetworld.git (fetch)
   origin	git@github.com:clintoncwolfe/widgetworld.git (push)
```

This says that Clinton's github account, widgetworld repo, will be used for sending and receiving updates.

## Making Changes

Let's suppose we want to add a note with our name to the README file. (We'll be making meaningful changes to other repos later)

### Make a topic branch

First, whenever you need to make a group of related changes, you should do it on a topic branch.  (Other workflows have other ideas about this, but this is the most common approach).

A branch is an efficient copy of the code, that lets you make changes without affecting the mainline of development.  This is important, beause you may need to work on several branches at once, switching between them.

```bash
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git checkout -b 'add-myself-to-readme'
```

### Make the change

OK, now we can edit files, and they will be on the new branch.

Use your favorite Unix editor - vim, emacs, joe, and nano are all installed.  If you have no idea what these mean, use nano.

```bash
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ nano README.rdoc
  # Add an AUTHORS section
  # Add Nell        # TODO - Nell should probably add this ahead of time, or create a AUTHORS file
  # Add yourself
```

### Ask git what it thinks is going on

We made a change.  What does git think?
```
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git status
  On branch add-myself-to-readme
  Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

  	modified:   README.rdoc

  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

So, git sees that a file is changed, but has no plans to commit them.  It suggests we use 'add' to include them in the commit.

```
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git add README.rdoc
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git status
  On branch add-myself-to-readme
  Changes to be committed:
    (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   README.rdoc
```

### Commit the change

OK, now we commit the change - telling git that it should consider this a "checkpoint".

```
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git add README.rdoc
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git commit -m "Adding myself to README"
  [add-myself-to-readme 3c903fb] Adding myself to README
    1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git status
   On branch add-myself-to-readme
   nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

## Publishing Changes

Great!  Let's check a few things.

### Check master for the change

So, we were working on a branch.  Did the "main" line of code get affected?  Let's swtich branches (using the 'checkout' command) back to the main line, usually called 'master'.

```
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git checkout master
   Switched to branch 'master'
   Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ more README.rdoc

```

Is the file changed?  It shouldn't be!  So, you see you can use branches to do experiments without affecting the main line.

### Check github for the change

Take a moment to look at your Github page.  You'll notice that your changes are not there yet - nor are they in Nell's.

### Push the change

To publish the change to another git repo (including those on hosting servers like github), we use the 'push' command, specifying which branch to push, and which remote to push to.

Note that git doesn't care what branch you are currently on;  if you explicitly name a branch it push, it will gather those changes and send them without affecting anything in your directory.


```
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git push origin add-myself-to-readme
  Counting objects: 5, done.
  Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
  Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 318 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
  Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
  To git@github.com:clintoncwolfe/widgetworld.git
   * [new branch]      add-myself-to-readme -> add-myself-to-readme
```

Notice that git thinks of that as a new branch on the remote.

### Check github for the change, again

Take a look at your github repo page.  You should see that you have a new branch!

## Submitting to the Maintainer

You're a generous person, and you want to share your hard work with the world.  You'd like to make it easy for Nell to accept your changes.

In hosted git like github and bitbucket, this action is called "submitting a pull request".  You're asking Nell to receive changes from you - the opposite of a push, a 'pull'.

In the github web UI, you shoudl see several opportunities to create a PR.  Go ahead and submit one, and describe why you think it is valuable.

Nell will get notifications that people want to contribute code.  As the maintainer, she can comment on your changes, request you make refinements (which you would do by pushing to your branch), and finally, accept or reject the PR.

This mechanism is how most Free and Open Source Software is developed.

## Merging to your master

But you don't hve to wait for Nell!  You run your own copy of the code, and can merge your branch back to your own master, if you wish to.

### Checking for upstream changes

If you're working on a shared repo, it's likely that master may have been updated.  Before merging a branch, it's your responsiblity to make sure that it is up to date as regards any changes.

First, let's make sure we have a fresh copy of your team's work.

```
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git checkout master  # Switch to master branch
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git pull master
```

'pull' Downloads and merges any changes from your team to your master branch.

Next, let's make sure your topic branch is compatible with the latest changes.

```
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git checkout add-myself-to-readme
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git rebase master
```

'rebase' and 'merge' do nearly the same thing; both pull the changes from the master branch into your topic branch (rebase simply pretends that all of master's changes happened "before" your changes, which can result in a cleaner history, but is much more likely to fail).  Different development teams have different, strong opinions about this.

At this point, you would test, and ensure that your changes work as expected.

### Merge to master

```
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git checkout master
  vagrant@workshop widgetworld $ git merge add-myself-to-readme
```

This says that the work on the topic branch is largely done, and the code changes should now be pulled into the main line.

This is a big deal; on some development teams, only the team lead, or a test drone, is allowed to merge to master.

Be sure to push after you merge!

# Next Steps

We now have the code of a web application, but no idea what it does or what it needs to run.  Let's start exporing the application dependencies!

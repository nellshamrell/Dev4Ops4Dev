We're going to use an automated deployment tool called [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/) to both do our initial deploy and future deploys.  Capistrano is frequently used with Ruby on Rails applications (it is written in Ruby) but can be used with other languages as well.

# Setting up the Rails application
```bash
  $ cd widgetworld
```

Open up the Gemfile

```bash
  $ vim Gemfile
```

Add this content

```bash
group :development do
  gem 'capistrano',  '~> 3.1'
  gem 'capistrano-rails', '~> 1.1'
  gem 'capistrano-rvm'
end
```

Then run:

```bash
  $ bundle
```

This will install all the necessary ruby gems for this application, including the ones needed for running Capistrano.

If you receive this error:

```bash
  Can't find the 'libpq-fe.h header
  *** extconf.rb failed ***
  Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary
  libraries and/or headers.
```

Run this on your development VM:

```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install postgresql-client libpq5 libpq-dev
  $ sudo gem install pg -v '0.17.1'
```

Then rerun:

```bash
  $ bundle
```

If you continue to get the same error, comment out the pg gem line in your Gemfile

```bash
  #gem 'pg'
```

(It was already installed when you ran "sudo gem install pg -v '0.17.1'")

Then rerun:

```bash
  $ bundle
```

# Installing and Configuring Capistrano

There is also some special additional installation for capistrano.  Run this command, which will add some additional Capistrano config files.

```bash
  $ cap install
```

Next, open your Capfile in your favorite editor

```bash
   $ vim Capfile
```

Uncomment this line

```bash
  # require 'capistrano/rvm'
```

So it looks like this

```bash
   require 'capistrano/rvm'
 ```

 Later on we'll be storing our database credentials (including password) in config/database.yml.  To avoid accidentally committing this to our potentially public repo, let's first make a copy of the file to serve as an example

 ```bash
  $ cp config/database.yml config/database_example.yml
 ```

 The open up your .gitignore file with your favorite editor

 ```bash
  $ vim .gitignore
 ```

 And add this line to the file

 ```bash
 config/database.yml
 ```

 This will keep the database.yml file out of any git commits, histories, or repos.

 While we're at it, let's also add config/secrets.yml.  Widget World is a Rails 4 application and Rails 4 added the secrets configuration file to contain credentials.  This is not something we want possible exposed to the world in source control, so add this line to your .gitignore file, then save and close the file.

 ```bash
 config/secrets.yml
 ```

 Next, open up the config/deploy.rb file with your favorite text editor

 ```bash
  $ vi config/deploy.rb
 ```

 Change these to lines
 ```bash
 set :application, 'my_app_name'
 set :repo_url, 'git@example.com:me/my_repo.git'
 ```

 To this

 ```bash
 set :application, 'widgetworld'
 set :repo_url, 'git@github.com:nellshamrell/widgetworld.git'
 ```

 Then change this line
 ```bash
 # set :deploy_to, '/var/www/my_app_name'
 ```

 To this

 ```bash
  set :deploy_to, '/var/www/widgetworld'
```

Then uncomment this line

```bash
  set :scm, :git
```

And uncomment this line

```bash
  set :linked_files, fetch(:linked_files, []).push('config/database.yml', 'config/secrets.yml')
```

Finally, uncomment this line
```bash
   set :linked_dirs, fetch(:linked_dirs, []).push('bin', 'log', 'tmp/pids', 'tm    p/cache', 'tmp/sockets', 'vendor/bundle', 'public/system')
 ```

 And add this sequence of lines right after "namespace :deploy do"
 ```bash
 namespace :deploy do


 desc 'Restart application'
   task :restart do
     on roles(:app), in: :sequence, wait: 5 do
      # This restarts Passenger
       execute :mkdir, '-p', "#{ release_path }/tmp"
      execute :touch, release_path.join('tmp/restart.txt')
    end
  end

  after :publishing, :restart
```

# Modifying our Chef recipe

In the changes we just made to config/deploy.rb, we specified that we would be deploying our application to a directory in /var/www on the VM.

We need to change the owner of this directory to deploy

First, change directories back to your cookbook.

```bash
  $ cd ~/my_web_server_chef_repo/cookbooks/my_web_server_cookbook
```

Let's create a new recipe, this one specifically for the app.

```bash
  $ chef generate recipe app
```

Now we need to create the directory where our server specs will live:

```bash
  $ mkdir -p test/integration/app/serverspec
```

And create the test file

```bash
  $ touch test/integration/app/serverspec/app_spec.rb
```

And we need to be able to access a spec_helper similar to the one living in test/integration/default/serverspec.  In this case, let's copy that one into our new integration test directory.

```bash
  $ cp test/integration/default/serverspec/spec_helper.rb test/integration/app/serverspec
```

Now let's create some tests, checking that the /var/www directory is owned by deploy and grouped in the deploy group.


test/integration/app/serverspec/app_spec.rb
```bash
require 'spec_helper'
describe 'my_web_server_cookbook::app' do
  describe file('/var/www') do
    it { should be_owned_by 'deploy' }
  end

  describe file('/var/www') do
    it { should be_grouped_into 'deploy' }
  end
end
```

Now we need to add this test suite to our .kitchen.yml file so Test Kitchen will run it.

Open up you .kitchen.yml file

```bash
  $ vim .kitchen.yml
```

And add this content:

```bash
suites:
- name: default
  run_list:
    - recipe[my_web_server_cookbook::default]
  attributes:
- name: ruby
  run_list:
    - recipe[my_web_server_cookbook::ruby]
  attributes:
- name: passenger
  run_list:
    - recipe[my_web_server_cookbook::passenger]
  attributes:
- name: postgresql
  run_list:
    - recipe[my_web_server_cookbook::postgresql]
  attributes:
- name: user
  run_list:
    - recipe[my_web_server_cookbook::user]
  attributes:
- name: app
  run_list:
    - recipe[my_web_server_cookbook::app]
  attributes:
```

Next you'll need to create a new test instance for the new suite:

```bash
  $ kitchen create app-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

And then set it up with Chef:

```bash
  $ kitchen setup app-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

Now, run the tests:

```bash
  $ kitchen verify app-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

And they should fail.


```bash
include_recipe 'my_web_server_cookbook::default'
include_recipe 'my_web_server_cookbook::deploy_user'

execute 'change owner and group' do
  command "sudo chown deploy:deploy /var/www"
  action :run
end
```

Now let's make them pass.  Open up recipes/app.rb and add this content:

```bash
include_recipe 'my_web_server_cookbook::default'
include_recipe 'my_web_server_cookbook::user'

execute 'change owner and group' do
  command "sudo chown deploy:deploy /var/www"
  action :run
 end
```

Now apply the changes:

```bash
  $ kitchen converge app-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

And run the tests again

```bash
  $ kitchen verify app-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

And they should pass!

Now we need to add this to our node's run list.  Open up nodes/[node's ip address].json and add this recipe to your run list:

```bash
  {
    "run_list": [
      "recipe[my_web_server_cookbook::default]",
      "recipe[my_web_server_cookbook::passenger]",
      "recipe[my_web_server_cookbook::ruby]",
      "recipe[my_web_server_cookbook::postgresql]",
      "recipe[my_web_server_cookbook::user]",
      "recipe[my_web_server_cookbook::app]"
    ]
  }
```

## Setting Capistrano roles

Now change back to your widgetworld directory

```bash
  $ cd ~/widgetworld
```

Take a look at the various deploy configs:

```bash
  $ ls config/deploy
```

You should see two configs, each corresponding to a different environment.

```bash
  production.rb  staging.rb
```

Let's use the staging config for right now.


Open up the config/deploy/staging.rb file. Uncomment and change these lines:

```bash
   role :app, %w{deploy@example.com}, my_property: :my_value
   role :web, %w{user1@primary.com user2@additional.com}, other_property: :other_value
   role :db,  %w{deploy@example.com}
```

To this

(Make sure to substitute the ip address for your testing node)

```bash
  role :app, %w{deploy@#{ip_address}}
  role :web, %w{deploy@#{ip_address}}
  role :db,  %w{deploy@#{ip_address}}
```

And uncomment and change this line

```bash
  server 'example.com', user: 'deploy', roles: %w{app db web}, my_property: :my_value
```

To this:

(Make sure to substitute the ip address for your testing node)

```bash
  server '#{ip_address}', user: 'deploy', roles: %w{web app}
```

Now let's check whether our application is ready to deploy to testing.  Run this command:

```bash
  $ cap staging deploy:check
```

Whoops, looks like it's prompting for a password.  This is because our ssh key is not on the testing instance for the deploy user.  Let's get that fixed.

## Adding your SSH Key

Change directories back to your chef cookbook.

```bash
  $ cd ~/my_web_server_chef_repo/cookbooks/my_web_server_cookbook/
```

Normally, we would add the SSH key through a user databag.  For the sake of time, we're going to use a template instead in this workshop.  However, a databag would be a better way to do this in a "real world" environment.  To learn more about databags, see [the Chef documentation on databags](http://docs.chef.io/data_bags.html).

First, we need to add an .ssh director to the deploy folder in the /home directory.  Let's add this into the user recipe.  Open up the user test file and add this test

test/integration/user/serverspec/user_spec.rb
```bash
  describe file('/home/deploy/.ssh') do
    it { should be_directory }
  end
```

And run the test:

```bash
  $ kitchen verify user-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

And, as expected, it fails.  Now let's make it pass.

Open up recipes/user.rb and add this content.

```bash
  execute 'create .ssh directory' do
    command "sudo mkdir /home/deploy/.ssh"
    action :run
    not_if { ::File.exists?("/home/deploy/.ssh")}
  end
```

Then converge and run the tests again.

```bash
  $ kitchen converge user-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

```bash
  $ kitchen verify user-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

And it passes!

Now we need to add in an authorized_keys file to this new directory, then populate it with our ssh key.

First, a test.

test/integration/user/serverspec/user_spec.rb
```bash
  describe file('/home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys') do
    it { should be_file }
    its(:content) { should match /ssh-rsa.+devops workshop key/ }
  end
```

Then, as usual, run the tests.

```bash
  $ kitchen verify user-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

And watch them fail.

Now let's make them pass.  We need a template with the SSH key in it.

Change directories back to your Chef repo directory

```bash
  $ cd ~/my_web_server_chef_repo
```

And generate the template.

```bash
  $ chef generate template cookbooks/my_web_server_cookbook ssh_key
```

Now change directories back to your cookbook directory:

```bash
  $ cd cookbooks/my_web_server_cookbook
```

Then open up the new template and add this content.

templates/default/ssh_key.erb
```bash
  [Paste in PUBLIC SSH Key provided by instructors]
```

Now add this into your recipes/user.rb file:

```bash
  template '/home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys' do
    source 'ssh_key.erb'
  end
```

And converge, then re-run the tests.

```bash
  $ kitchen converge user-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

```bash
  $ kitchen verify user-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

And they should pass!

Now let's apply these changes to our testing node.  Run this command:

```bash
  $ knife solo cook root@[testing_node_ip_address]
```

## Deploying again

Let's switch back to the widgetworld directory.

```bash
  $ cd ~/widgetworld
```

And try the deploy check again.

```bash
  $ cap staging deploy:check
```

If receive git error, do this:

```bash
  $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Then run the deploy check again.

```bash
  $ cap staging deploy:check
```

And it fails for hopefully the last time.

```bash
  ERROR linked file /var/www/widgetworld/shared/config/database.yml does not exist
```

Capistrano expects to find a file that isn't there.  Let's get this taken care of.

[For the sake of time, we're not adding this file into our Chef cookbook.  However, extra credit points to any student who figures out how to!)

SSH into your test instance.

```bash
  ssh deploy@192.241.201.66
```

Create and open this file on your VM.
```bash
  $ vim /var/www/widgetworld/shared/config/database.yml
```

And add this content:
```bash
# PostgreSQL. Versions 8.2 and up are supported.
#
# Install the pg driver:
#   gem install pg
# On OS X with Homebrew:
#   gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/usr/local/bin/pg_config
# On OS X with MacPorts:
#   gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/opt/local/lib/postgresql84/bin/pg_config
# On Windows:
#   gem install pg
#       Choose the win32 build.
#       Install PostgreSQL and put its /bin directory on your path.
#
# Configure Using Gemfile
# gem 'pg'
#
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
# For details on connection pooling, see rails configuration guide
# http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#database-pooling
pool: 5

development:
  <<: *default
  database: widgetworld_development

# The specified database role being used to connect to postgres.
# To create additional roles in postgres see `$ createuser --help`.
# When left blank, postgres will use the default role. This is
# the same name as the operating system user that initialized the database.
username: nellshamrell

# The password associated with the postgres role (username).
#password:

# Connect on a TCP socket. Omitted by default since the client uses a
# domain socket that doesn't need configuration. Windows does not have
# domain sockets, so uncomment these lines.
#host: localhost

# The TCP port the server listens on. Defaults to 5432.
# If your server runs on a different port number, change accordingly.
#port: 5432

# Schema search path. The server defaults to $user,public
#schema_search_path: myapp,sharedapp,public

# Minimum log levels, in increasing order:
#   debug5, debug4, debug3, debug2, debug1,
#   log, notice, warning, error, fatal, and panic
# Defaults to warning.
#min_messages: notice

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: widgetworld_test

# As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="postgres://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
#

<<: *default
  database: widgetworld_production
  username: deploy
  password: <%= ENV['WIDGETWORLD_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
```

Then save and close the file.

Did you notice that the password refers to an environment variable?  This is because passwords can be dangerous to keep in source code.  Now we need to set that environment variable.

Let's set that environment variable now.  On your testing VM, run this command:

```bash
   $ export WIDGETWORLD_DATABASE_PASSWORD=[password you used in your chef recipe for the deploy user to login to postgres]
```

[TO DO: Set this in node configuration in Chef recipe?]

Now let's just create a file at /var/www/widgetworld/shared/secrets.yml.  We'll explain more about this and add content to it in a little bit.

```bash
  $ touch /var/www/widgetworld/shared/config/secrets.yml
```

Now go ahead and exit out of your VM.

Back on your development box, make sure you're in the widgetworld directory.

```bash
  $ cd ~/widgetworld
```

Then run the deploy check one more time.

```bash
  $ cap staging deploy:check
```

If it does not return an error and exits with a line similar to:

```bash
  DEBUG [7f34dcb9] Finished in 0.004 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
```

Then we're ready to deploy for real!

## Deploying with Capistrano

Deploy with

```bash
 $ cap staging deploy
```

Then ssh back into your VM (this time as the DEPLOY user, not root)

```bash
  ssh deploy@[your test instance's IP address]
```

Install bundler

```bash
$ sudo gem install bundler
```

Change to your application directory.

```bash
$ cd /var/www/widgetworld/current
```

And run bundler in this directory.

```bash
  $ bundle
```

## Configuring Secrets file

[TO DO: Set this in node configuration in Chef recipe?]

There's one more file we need to configure.  Rails 4 introduced the concept of a secrets file.  For more info, check out (this blog post)[http://richonrails.com/articles/the-rails-4-1-secrets-yml-file].

Open up this file with your editor of choice.

```bash
  $ vim /var/www/widgetworld/shared/config/secrets.yml
```

And add this content.

```bash
  # Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

  # Your secret key is used for verifying the integrity of signed cookies.
  # If you change this key, all old signed cookies will become invalid!

  # Make sure the secret is at least 30 characters and all random,
  # no regular words or you'll be exposed to dictionary attacks.
  # You can use `rake secret` to generate a secure secret key.

  # Make sure the secrets in this file are kept private
  # if you're sharing your code publicly.

  development:
    secret_key_base: 7ddf23906edc95aed228a016bf57ceda80901d9b0a8d58a5798a54fa5aa4e8509425ff7df5d63f65a393cc27f1ebd4820ff18d5c9d3d753d38037bb9287d9037

  test:
    secret_key_base: 5c565a66bd249c306d5b399086b238fe506fba9a7dc1779459fcc2239fd784b8fa156f64fbb3a0b7ed82bc4fb302bd6fc7dec79976ffc5c9abde95bd21c5a3ba

  # Do not keep production secrets in the repository,
  # instead read values from the environment.
    production:
      secret_key_base: <%= ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE"] %>
```

Save and close the file.

Notice another environment variable?  <%= ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE"] %>

We need to set this, but first we need to generate a sequence to use as our secret key base. Do this by running this command:

```bash
  $ RAILS_ENV=staging rake secret
```

This will output a code to use as our secret key base.

Now let's create the environmental variable to store this key. Open up your bash profile in an editor:

[TO DO: Do this through Chef?]

```bash
  $ vim ~/.bash_profile
```

And add this line to the end of the file

```bash
  export SECRET_KEY_BASE=[code you just generated]
```
Save and close the file, then reload your bash profile

```bash
  $ source ~/.bash_profile
```

You can then make sure this variable is set correctly by running

```bash
  $ echo $SECRET_KEY_BASE
```

## Setting up the databases
  Next, create the database for your Rails application and run migrations with these commands
```bash
  $ RAILS_ENV=production rake db:create
  $ RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
```

Then go ahead and exit out of your VM.

## Making Apache aware of our site

Finally, we need to make Apache aware of our new site.

Make sure you're back in you Development VM, then change to your cookbook directory.

```bash
  $ cd ~/my_web_server_chef_repo/cookbooks/my_web_server_cookbook
```

First, let's add a test to test/integration/app/serverspec/app.rb

```bash
  describe file('/etc/apache2/apache2.conf') do
    it { should be_file }
    its(:content) { should match /<VirtualHost \*:80>/ }
  end
```

Then run the test to watch it fail.

```bash
  $ kitchen verify app-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

Now let's make it pass.

Modify your Apache config template.  Add these lines to the file (no worries if hardcoding the IP makes you twitch, we'll change that shortly).

Now create a new Apache 2 template for use with the app recipe.

You need to run the generate template command from your my_web_server_chef_repo directory

```bash
  $ cd ~/my_web_server_chef_repo
```

```bash
  $ chef generate template cookbooks/my_web_server_cookbook app-apache2.conf
```

Now change directories back to your cookbook directory:

```bash
  $ cd cookbooks/my_web_server_cookbook
```

Now open up your new template file and add this content.


templates/default/app-apache2.conf.erb
```bash
# This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ for detailed information about
# the directives and /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian about Debian specific
# hints.
#
#
# Summary of how the Apache 2 configuration works in Debian:
# The Apache 2 web server configuration in Debian is quite different to
# upstream's suggested way to configure the web server. This is because Debian's
# default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,
# virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in
# order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as
# possible.

# It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined
# below, all located in the /etc/apache2/ directory:
#
#       /etc/apache2/
#       |-- apache2.conf
#       |       `--  ports.conf
#       |-- mods-enabled
#       |       |-- *.load
#       |       `-- *.conf
#       |-- conf-enabled
#       |       `-- *.conf
#       `-- sites-enabled
#               `-- *.conf
#
#
# * apache2.conf is the main configuration file (this file). It puts the pieces
#   together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the
#   web server.
#
# * ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is
#   supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections which can be
#   customized anytime.
#
# * Configuration files in the mods-enabled/, conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/
#   directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules,
#   global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations,
#   respectively.
#
#   They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their
#   respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our
#   helpers a2enmod/a2dismod, a2ensite/a2dissite and a2enconf/a2disconf. See
#   their respective man pages for detailed information.
#
# * The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in
#   the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with
#   /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not
#   work with the default configuration.


# Global configuration
#

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# NOTE!  If you intend to place this on an NFS (or otherwise network)
# mounted filesystem then please read the Mutex documentation (available
# at <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#mutex>);
# you will save yourself a lot of trouble.
#
# Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
#
#ServerRoot "/etc/apache2"

# The accept serialization lock file MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL DISK.
#

#
# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
# identification number when it starts.
# This needs to be set in /etc/apache2/envvars
#
PidFile ${APACHE_PID_FILE}

#
# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
#

#
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
#
KeepAlive On

#
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
#
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the
# same client on the same connection.
#
KeepAliveTimeout 5


# These need to be set in /etc/apache2/envvars
User ${APACHE_RUN_USER}
Group ${APACHE_RUN_GROUP}

#
# HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
# e.g., www.apache.org (on) or 204.62.129.132 (off).
# The default is off because it'd be overall better for the net if people
# had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it means that
# each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup request to the
# nameserver.

```

Then add this to your recipe/default.rb file

recipes/app.rb
```bash
  template '/etc/apache2/apache2.conf' do
    source 'app-apache2.conf.erb'
  end
```

And save and close the file.

Make sure to apply these changes to your testing instance.

```bash
  $ knife solo cook root@[testing_node_ip_address]
```

Now let's try our deploy one more time.

Make sure you're in your widgetworld directory

```bash
  $ cap staging deploy
```

Once that completes, check out your IP address in a browser.

Wait a minute....we're still seeing our custom home page, not a rails application.  What gives?

Let's do a bit of troubleshooting.

Go ahead and ssh into your testing instance.

```bash
  $ ssh deploy@[IP address for your testing instance]
```

And let's take a look at the passenger processes:

```bash
  $ passenger-memory-stats
```

Looks like no passenger process are being run, so our rails application is not being rendered

```bash
  --- Passenger processes ---

  ### Processes: 0
  ### Total private dirty RSS: 0.00 MB
```

There are three passenger processes that must be running in order for our Rails application to work - PassengerAgent watchdog, PassengerAgent server, PassengerAgent logger

Let's write a test for this, open up test/integration/app/serverspec/app_spec.rb

Then add this content:

```bash
 describe command('passenger-memory-stats') do
   its(:stdout) { should match /PassengerAgent watchdog/ }
   its(:stdout) { should match /PassengerAgent server/ }
   its(:stdout) { should match /PassengerAgent logger/ }
 end
```

And run the test and watch it fail.

```bash
  $ kitchen verify app-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

Now let's add in the code to make it pass

recipes/app.rb
```bash
  service 'apache2' do
    action [:restart]
  end
```

Then converge and run the tests:

```bash
  $ kitchen converge app-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

```bash
  $ kitchen verify app-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

And looks like there's an error:

```bash

```

This is happening because we already ran our Chef cookbooks, but it is trying to run our earliest cookbook (the default cookbook) and is running into problems because of our later cookbooks.  To make sure we can re-run our cookbook when we make changes, let's fix this.

Let's create a new Apache config template for our default recipe to use so we don't run into this conflict.

You need to run the generate template command from your my_web_server_chef_repo directory

```bash
  $ cd ~/my_web_server_chef_repo
```

```bash
  $ chef generate template cookbooks/my_web_server_cookbook apache2.conf
```

Now change directories back to your cookbook directory:

```bash
  $ cd cookbooks/my_web_server_cookbook
```

And add this content (just a plain, vanilla apache config file that the default recipe will use).

```bash
# This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ for detailed information about
# the directives and /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian about Debian specific
# hints.
#
#
# Summary of how the Apache 2 configuration works in Debian:
# The Apache 2 web server configuration in Debian is quite different to
# upstream's suggested way to configure the web server. This is because Debian's
# default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,
# virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in
# order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as
# possible.

# It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined
# below, all located in the /etc/apache2/ directory:
#
#       /etc/apache2/
#       |-- apache2.conf
#       |       `--  ports.conf
#       |-- mods-enabled
#       |       |-- *.load
#       |       `-- *.conf
#       |-- conf-enabled
#       |       `-- *.conf
#       `-- sites-enabled
#               `-- *.conf
#
#
# * apache2.conf is the main configuration file (this file). It puts the pieces
#   together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the
#   web server.
#
# * ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is
#   supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections which can be
#   customized anytime.
#
# * Configuration files in the mods-enabled/, conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/
#   directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules,
#   global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations,
#   respectively.
#
#   They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their
#   respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our
#   helpers a2enmod/a2dismod, a2ensite/a2dissite and a2enconf/a2disconf. See
#   their respective man pages for detailed information.
#
# * The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in
#   the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with
#   /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not
#   work with the default configuration.


# Global configuration

# at <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#mutex>);
# you will save yourself a lot of trouble.

#
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
#
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the

# The default is off because it'd be overall better for the net if people
# had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it means that
# each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup request to the
# nameserver.

Now add a call to this template in the recipes/default.rb file

```bash
  template '/etc/apache2/apache2.conf' do
    source 'apache2.conf.erb'
  end
```

```bash
  $ kitchen converge app-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

```bash
  $ kitchen verify app-ubuntu-14-04-x64
```

And they should pass!

Now look at your testing instance's IP address in the browser...

And congratulations!  You now have a working testing web server that you have deployed your application to and it works!
